        A blockchain is a type of Digital Ledger Technology (DLT) that consists of growing list of records, called blocks, that are securely linked 
        together using cryptography.[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle
        The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was created. Since each block contains information about the block previous to it, they effectively form
        with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block
        cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as
        a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to 
        add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible,
        blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.
